    <h2><span class="emoji">🎭</span> The Heart of Art and Music: Zefarina Valley</h2>
    <div class="content">In Fantasmeria, art is not just for expression. It is also a way to communicate. Every year, the Whisper of Dreams Festival happens in Zefarina Valley. People turn their thoughts into pictures, music, and dance. The special part is: the brushes use emotions instead of normal paint. The stronger and purer the feeling, the brighter the color. Music is made with “wind strings,” which are invisible instruments floating in the air. Artists use only their souls to play them and create melodies.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="card" onclick="toggleContent(this)">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🎇</span> Rituals and Special Days</h2>
    <div class="content">The people of Fantasmeria are very close to nature and dreams. Every year, they celebrate a holy day called The Awakening of Zeroya. On this day, everyone writes their best dream on a paper and hangs it on the big Dream Tree. People believe that dreams touching the tree will come true one day. There is also a tradition called The Silence Ritual. On this day, nobody speaks for a whole day. They only use gestures and eye contact. This helps people listen to their own thoughts.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="card" onclick="toggleContent(this)">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🏟️</span> Sports and Competitions</h2>
    <div class="content">In Fantasmeria, sports are both physical and mental. The most popular sport is Zekaflux. In this game, two players use mind power to control a flying, shape-changing ball. It is like a mix of chess and quidditch. Another game is The Memory Maze. Players must find their way out of a changing maze using only their imagination and memories.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="card" onclick="toggleContent(this)">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🏛️</span> Architecture and Homes</h2>
    <div class="content">Homes in Fantasmeria are not normal buildings. Each home grows with its owner’s imagination. For example, if someone loves seashells, their house may look like a blue-green spiral with wave shapes. Homes act like living things: when sad, their windows fog up; when happy, flowers fall from the ceiling. The tallest building is The Awakening Tower. At night, it shines with the sky and shows parts of people’s dreams.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="card" onclick="toggleContent(this)">
    <h2><span class="emoji">🧝‍♀️</span> Legends and Symbolic People</h2>
    <div class="content">One of the oldest stories in Fantasmeria is about The Golden-Winged Dream Bird. People say this bird comes only when someone’s dream is strong enough to save another person’s life. Long ago, a little girl dreamed that no one should be lonely. Her dream connected all the people of Fantasmeria with telepathy. Since then, they could talk with their minds. In Fantasmeria, people respect dreams more than heroes.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="card" onclick="toggleContent(this)">
    <h2><span class="emoji">✨</span> Language and Symbols</h2>
    <div class="content">Fantasmeria’s language is called Zerotika. People speak it with voice and glowing signs. The letters also show emotions: the letter “A” means joy, and “R” means longing. When written, the words move a little — because in Fantasmeria, words are alive. The Fantasmeria flag shows the spiral leaf of the Zeroya plant, which means endless imagination.</div>
